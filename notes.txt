Schema -> Define the structure
    Make Model - by using Schema
    Using Model we do CRUD operations


A schema is like a blueprint or design that tells what fields and what type of data each document in a collection should have.
ex:-
    const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        name: String,
        age: Number,
        email: String,
    });


A model is created using a schema and is used to interact with the actual MongoDB collection.
With a model, you can create, read, update, or delete documents.
